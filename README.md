Hey Evan,

I spent a couple hours working on the site so far! I've mostly been copying the content and styling from the old site, but I did change the orientation and position of the navigation menu (although I still have get it to stick to the top when you scroll).

Here's a link to a temporary site where you can view what I've worked on so far:

and here's a link to the repo, where this code lives on GitHub:

Check out some of the .html files and see if you can decipher what's going on in the Recordings and About page, for example, just to see if you'll be able to modify things as you wish. I can write some templates and explanations if you need them, just let me know!

Do you want the About page to look basically the same as the recordings page? 

Some other things I still need to do:
- Add videos to the video page
- Get a link to the calendar, figure out how to add the calendar to Events, then figure out if we can style it
